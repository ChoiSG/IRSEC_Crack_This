# If a server has mysql running (ex. HTTP server with LAMP stack), there is a chance
# there might be trickshot (https://github.com/RITRedteam/Trickshot/) running. 
# 
# Use the following to find trickshot! 

1. See for suspicious mysql function 
mysql -u root -p<password> -e"select * from mysql.func" 
    >> if there is tg.so, that's trickshot. 


2. See for suspicous plugin with specific string 
strings /usr/lib/mysql/plugin/* | grep sys_exec_deinit
    >> If sys_exec_deinit is found, that plugin is the trickshot plugin.

3. If Trickshot EXISTS 
mysql -u root -p<password> -e"drop function <function_name>" 

4. Also, delete the plugin file (<trickshot>.so) in /usr/lib/mysql/plugin as well.
